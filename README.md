# Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

I have always enjoyed problem-solving and tinkering with systems, which makes working with data feel natural to me. I have 9 years of clinical and leadership experience as a Physical Therapist in healthcare and data analysis has been integral to both my diagnostic and treatment approaches as well as my administrative responsibilities.

One of my first initiatives upon accepting my leadership role was to have custom reports built into our EHR system, allowing outcomes data to be exported to spreadsheets, significantly streamlining our chart auditing process. Around this same time, I began learning Python and discovered that I might enjoy data work as a primary focus rather than just a supporting function of my current role.

Since then, I have expanded my skills to include SQL and Tableau, continuously incorporating data analytics practices into my administrative duties. I have developed comprehensive reports for fall prevention, stroke outcomes, operational efficiency, and patient experience, demonstrating how data-driven insights can improve healthcare delivery and outcomes.
